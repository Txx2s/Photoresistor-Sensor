# Photoresistor-Sensor
Light intensity test using Photressistor Sensor.


OBJECTIVE: 
In this experiment, we are going to work with a sensor, which is a resistor that depends on light. In 
a dark environment, the resistor will have a very high resistance. As photons (light) land on the 
detector, the resistance will decrease. The more light is we will have a lower resistance. By reading 
different values from the sensor, we can detect if is it light, dark or a value between them. 
Another element that we are going to use on this experiment is Piezo Buzzer.

A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a 
photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits 
photoconductivity. A photoresistor can be applied in light- sensitive detector circuits, and lightand dark-activated switching circuits. The resistance of the photoresistor changes with incident 
light intensity. If the incident light intensity is high, the resistance reduces; if low, increases.

Step 1: Connect circuit as shown in the next diagram: 
Step 2: Write the code. 
Step 3: Verify and Compile the code. 
Step 4: Burn or upload the program into Arduino Uno board.
